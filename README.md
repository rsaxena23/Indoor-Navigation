# Indoor-Navigation

  An android application used to find a person's location in building premises using the 
  Wifi Signal Strength of nearyby routers and validating it with motion sensors present in smartphones.
  
  The algorithm used is generic and is a trilatertion algorithm with some sampling due to the fluctuation of wifi signals.
  
  The application is subjective to the building it is being developed for as one would need the 
  floor images/maps and router  mac addresses. The code present here is one implemented for a 
  specific building (my undergraduate college) and was successfully able to dynamically display a person's location
  in the building across floors.
